# LinkedListTrio
A collection of linked lists data structures for personal use

VERSION 1

Contains a singularly linked list, a doubly linked list and a circular doubly linked list. 
All linked lits have a front pointer, a back pointer, and the size of the list (in integer). They also have the basic dictionary operations (Insert, Remove and Retrieve).
No sorting algorithms implemented yet. Will implement in version 1.2

VERSION 1.2

Added the SortList for SLinkedList as well as added PrintArray()
